# budapest-transport-analysis
 
The Hungarian capital, Budapest, has a growing population of close to 2 million people, who require an extensive public transport network. The purpose if this paper is to analyse the operation of Budapest’s public transport by exploring the openly accessible GTFS (General Transit Feed Specification) data format. The analysis will further investigate public bus routes as a key part of the urban transportation mix. Discovering key similarities among bus routes will help identify clusters of bus services with different characteristics across the city. Improving our understanding of the Budapest bus network could enhance the efficiency of schedules to better serve the population’s transportation requirements as well as reduce congestions, optimise bus lane arrangements, and decrease air pollution. 

Budapest’s residents have significantly different transportation needs during the weekdays and weekends. Therefore, paper will differentiate between a regular weekday’s and weekend’s transportation schedule to provide comparison between the two contrasting operation mode.
